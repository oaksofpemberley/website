In the fast-paced world of technology, innovation is often incremental. We see countless derivative products and services that build upon existing foundations. While this evolution is essential, true breakthroughs – those that redefine industries and open up entirely new possibilities – are the real game-changers.
Think back to the early days of the internet. In 1997, search engines like AltaVista were slow and unreliable. Then came Google, with its clean interface, lightning-fast results, and revolutionary PageRank algorithm. It wasn’t just an improvement; it was a paradigm shift.
The transition from gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles offers another example. Electric cars are faster, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly. While the underlying analysis technology remains similar, the fundamental capabilities are vastly superior. 

## Streaming Graphs: The Next Breakthrough?

Today, I believe we’re on the cusp of another such breakthrough: streaming graph technology. Like the SR-71 Blackbird, a plane that pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible with its innovative ramjet engines, streaming graphs are poised to revolutionize data analysis.
Imagine being able to process a million data points or more per second while actively querying the system. This is the power of streaming graphs. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Walmart are likely already using custom-built versions of this technology internally. But what if this capability were available to the masses?

## The Potential Impact

Streaming graphs could transform industries. In cybersecurity, they could enable real-time threat detection and analysis. In finance, they could empower high-frequency trading algorithms. And in retail, they could fuel personalized recommendation engines that adapt instantly to customer behavior.
Consider the Target example based on standard analytics. By analyzing massive amounts of customer data, Target was able to predict a teenager’s pregnancy before her father knew. With streaming graphs, this level of all-domain awareness and complex pattern identification could become commonplace. 
Knowledge graphs, which are becoming increasingly popular with large language model (LLM) retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques, could also benefit from streaming graph technology. Imagine eliminating knowledge graph’s inherent slowness and enabling real-time analysis of enterprise data fabrics.
Quine: An Open-Source Solution
While streaming graph technology might seem out of reach for many organizations, open-source projects like Quine makes it accessible today. Although the open source version of Quine only runs on a single machine, it’s a starting point for those who want to explore this cutting-edge technology. A commercial version is also available to scale horizontally to the largest enterprise workloads.
